# Evergreen-Project
This serves as the document revision control for our solar greenhouse project.
# Solar Greenhouse Project

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Solar Greenhouse Project repository! This project focuses on the development of an innovative, sustainable greenhouse powered by solar energy. Our goal is to design and implement a system that maximizes energy efficiency while promoting sustainable agricultural practices.

## Document Revision Control
This section controls the development and distribution of revisions to the project documentation. Maintaining a clear revision record is crucial for tracking the document's evolution, understanding changes, and ensuring transparency during project audits.

### Importance of Revision Records
- **Document Evolution:** Helps team members and newcomers understand how documents have changed over time.
- **Audit Readiness:** Essential for project audits and reviews.
- **Version Retrieval:** Modern document management systems like Git allow us to retrieve any version of a document.
- **Change Comparison:** Tools can compare versions and highlight changes for easy review.
